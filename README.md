To run script:

- File -> Scripts -> Other Script -> select script file (.jsx)

To add a script to the menu:

- Go to Adobe product install folder
- Then to folder Presets/en_US/Scripts
- Put a .jsx file there
- Restart the program

In **Photoshop** it's possible to assign a shortcut to a script (from Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts menu).
**Illustrator** (CC 2015) doesn't allow it, so I put 'a_' before the script name and used **Alt + F + R + Enter** to quickly execute it.
