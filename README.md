To run a script:

- for **Illustrator**: File -> Scripts -> Other Script... -> select a .jsx file (`Shift+F12`)
- for **Photoshop**: File -> Scripts -> Browse...

To add a script to the menu `File -> Scripts`:

- Go to Adobe product install folder
- Then to folder `Presets/en_US/Scripts`
- Put a .jsx file there
- Restart the program

In **Photoshop** it's possible to assign a shortcut to a script (from `Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts` menu).  
**Illustrator** (CC 2015) doesn't allow it, so I put *'a_'* before the script name and use **Alt + F + R + Enter** to quickly execute it.
